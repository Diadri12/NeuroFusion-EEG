Run Date: 2026-01-28 16:14:57

THESIS SUMMARY:
"Baseline dual-branch CNN with weighted CrossEntropy shows partial class 
separability with macro F1 of 0.0872. The architecture combines 
convolutional feature learning (Branch A) with handcrafted EEG features 
(Branch B), achieving 0.00%, 0.00%, 
and 100.00% recall across the three classes respectively."

KEY RESULTS:
- Macro F1: 0.0872
- Accuracy: 0.1505
- All classes predicted: False
- Architecture: CNN (NO BiLSTM) + Feature Encoder

LIMITATIONS IDENTIFIED:
- Limited temporal dependency modeling (CNN only)
- Moderate performance on minority classes
- No long-range pattern capture

NEXT STEP:
→ Phase 3 Representation Learning (BiLSTM enhancement)
   Expected: Improved temporal modeling → Higher macro F1
