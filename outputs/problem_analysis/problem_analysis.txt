1. DATASET OVERVIEW

Total Samples: 289,010
Number of Classes: 3
Signal Length: 51 samples

2. CLASS DISTRIBUTION

Class 0: 173,035 samples (59.87%)
Class 1:  72,474 samples (25.08%)
Class 2:  43,501 samples (15.05%)

Imbalance Ratio: 3.98:1
Severity: MODERATE

3. IDENTIFIED PROBLEMS


CRITICAL ISSUE: Class Imbalance

Problem:
  - Majority class (0) contains 59.9% of data
  - Minority class (2) contains only 15.1% of data
  - Ratio of 3.98:1 is significant

Impact on Learning:
  - Model biased toward predicting majority class
  - High accuracy but poor minority class detection
  - Low F1, precision, recall scores
  - Identical results across different architectures

Evidence:
  - All models achieve ~59.9% accuracy
  - F1 scores are low (~0.45)
  - Confusion matrix shows empty predictions for minority classes


4. RECOMMENDED SOLUTIONS

Solution 1: Class-Weighted Loss Function (CRITICAL)
  - Compute balanced class weights
  - Use CrossEntropyLoss(weight=class_weights)
  - Forces model to pay attention to minority classes

Solution 2: Improved Feature Extraction
  - Enhance STFT parameters (larger window, more overlap)
  - Apply log scaling for better dynamic range
  - Increases discriminative power

Solution 3: Ablation Study
  - Train baseline (raw only)
  - Train STFT-only model
  - Train dual-branch fusion
  - Proves fusion value scientifically

5. EXPECTED OUTCOMES

After applying solutions:
  ✓ F1 score should increase significantly
  ✓ Precision/recall become balanced
  ✓ Minority classes actually get predicted
  ✓ Confusion matrix becomes more diagonal
  ✓ Different architectures show different performance
